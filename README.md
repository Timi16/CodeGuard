CodeGuard
CodeGuard is a powerful and advanced security tool designed to help developers detect common security vulnerabilities within their codebase. This extension integrates static analysis tools to automatically identify issues such as misplaced secrets, XSS vulnerabilities, SQL injections, and other security flaws.

Features
Secret Detection: Detects hardcoded API keys, secret keys, passwords, and tokens in your code to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection: Scans for potential XSS vulnerabilities in your web applications.
SQL Injection Detection: Identifies code patterns that may be susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
Supported Languages and Frameworks
CodeGuard is designed to work across multiple programming languages and web frameworks, including but not limited to:

Python: Django, Flask
JavaScript/TypeScript: Express.js, React
Java: Spring, Play
Go: Gin, Echo
Ruby: Ruby on Rails
